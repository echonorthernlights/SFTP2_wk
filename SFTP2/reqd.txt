Asynchronous Programming:

To turn your service asynchronous, methods should be marked as async and return Task (or Task<T>).
Use the await keyword when calling other asynchronous methods.
Async Methods:

If you have a method that supports asynchronous operations (like downloading a file from an SFTP server), call it directly using await:
csharp
Copy code
public async Task DownloadFromSFTPAsync(string sftpHost, string username, string password, string remoteFilePath, string localFilePath)
{
    await sftpClient.DownloadFileAsync(sftpHost, username, password, remoteFilePath, localFilePath);
}
Synchronous Methods:

If you're dealing with a synchronous method (not marked as async and doesn't return Task), you can use Task.Run to execute it asynchronously:
csharp
Copy code
public Task DownloadFileSync(string sftpHost, string username, string password, string remoteFilePath, string localFilePath)
{
    return Task.Run(() =>
    {
        // Perform the synchronous download operation here
    });
}
Key Takeaways:

Use await for asynchronous methods.
Use Task.Run for synchronous methods when you want to execute them asynchronously.
Best Practices:

Prefer using native asynchronous methods when available to avoid unnecessary overhead from Task.Run.
Structure your methods to handle I/O-bound operations efficiently with asynchronous programming for better performance and responsiveness.
